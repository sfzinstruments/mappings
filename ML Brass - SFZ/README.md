Before you continue, download the .SFZ mapping from the "ML Brass SFZ File" folder.

## How to use the sfz mapping

1. In order to use Kontakt libraries with .NCW files, you need to use Kontakt to extract them.

I would recommend setting the destination folder to a different folder called "ML Brass SFZ" or something similar to that.

4. Now that you have the files, you need to put the ML Brass.sfz file in the folder that the "ML Brass Samples" folder is in.

5. Now you should delete the files with endings like "-[1]", like the ones highlighted below.

6. Lastly, you need to rename this file, change the end from "_03", to "_02".
